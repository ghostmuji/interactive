and the universe said the darkness you fight is within you
	 <br>
	 <br>

	 <br>
	 <br>
and the universe said the light you seek is within you

	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
and the universe said you are not alone

	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
and the universe said you are not separate from every other thing
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
and the universe said you are the universe tasting itself, talking to itself, reading its own code
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
and the universe said I love you because you are love.
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
And the game was over and the player woke up from the dream. 
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 And the player began a new dream. And the player dreamed again, dreamed better. 
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 And the player was the universe. And the player was love.
	 <br>
	 <br>
You are the player.
	 <br>
	 <br>
Wake up.
