		<p> The atoms in your body were created at the start of our universe during the Big Bang. ･ﾟ☆ So if you look at it this way, then you’re about 13.7 billion years old. </p>

	<div align ="center">
		<p> ✧*･ﾟ But your body also has heavier elements like copper and zinc. These atoms were created in the dying stage of an exploding star called a supernova. </p>
	</div>

	<div align ="center">
		<p> These elements were flung into space as dust and gas (stardust). Eventually, they coalesced to become part of a new forming solar system and ☆.* our planet Earth </p>

		<p> <i> Why are stars like element factories? </i> </p>
	</div>
	<div align ="center">
		<p> ･ﾟ☆  As we already know, hydrogen and helium have been around since the Big Bang. So stars (like our Sun) take lighter elements like hydrogen and build heavier ones like helium, carbon, and oxygen.  </p>
	</div>
	<div align ="center">
		<p> It’s through fusion reaction that stars build elements of their own. But stars can only produce elements as heavy as iron. ✧*･ﾟ Anything heavier is made when the star becomes a supernova </p>
	</div>
	<div align ="center">
		<p> When a star is at the end of its life, its temperature begins to increase. At about 200 million degrees, helium fuses into carbon and oxygen. Then at above 3 billion degrees, it creates silicon, iron, and nickel. </p>
	</div>
	<div align ="center">
		<p> If our sun was bigger, it would go through the process of a supernova. High-mass stars simply don’t burn out of fuel. Instead, it ejects matter violently into space building heavier elements like gold and uranium. </p>

		<p> <i> How do supernovas build heavier elements? </i> </p>
	</div>
	<div align ="center">
		<p> Stars larger than our sun goes through a faster cycle with more intense pressure. ✧*･ﾟ But larger stars have so much energy that they don’t simply ☆.* die and turn into a white dwarf.  </p>
	</div>
	<div align ="center">
		<p> Instead, they expand into a red super-giant and then explode in a dramatic event called a supernova. It blasts material dramatically into space. Eventually, they can then collapse as a neutron star or black hole.</p>
	</div>
	<div align ="center">
		<p> ･ﾟ☆ Supernova is important because they form the more complicated elements on Earth from hydrogen to uranium. Supernovas build anything in our periodic table that is heavier than iron. </p>
	</div>
	<div align ="center">
		<p> The process of building heavier atoms than hydrogen is called nucleosynthesis. It happens because neutron gets added into much larger atoms. These are the 92 natural elements, many of which are used to create rocks and minerals. </p>

		<p> <i> How do our sun’s fusion reactions work? </i> </p>
	</div>
	<div align ="center">
		<p> Fusion smashes two or more atomic nuclei together and builds a heavier nucleus. For example, our Sun constantly fuses hydrogen into helium. This process releases energy and sunlight, constantly warming our planet. </p>
	</div>
	<div align ="center">
		<p> When stars like our Sun finish using hydrogen in the core, then it will begin fusing the leftover helium into carbon and oxygen. When this begins, the star will swell up into a red giant.</p>
	</div>
	<div align ="center">
		<p> Based on the initial mass of the star, successive fusion reactions may follow. Starting with hydrogen, it can fuse into helium, carbon, oxygen, neon, silicon, and iron.･ﾟ☆</p>
	</div>
	<div align ="center">
		<p> If the star has more mass, then it will go further down the chain of reactions all the way up to iron. But if a star has enough mass to fuse iron, it will then supernova once that fusion is complete.</p>
